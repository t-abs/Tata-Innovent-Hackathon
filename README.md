STEPS-

1. Traditional AI Solutions:

a. Data Collection:

Gather sensor data, machine logs, and operational metrics.

b. Data Preprocessing:
Clean data (remove outliers, handle missing values).

c. Normalize and scale features.

Engineer relevant features (e.g., moving averages, ratios).

d. Model Building:

Develop and train predictive models (e.g., regression, classification).

Use historical data to identify patterns and trends.

e. Diagnostics:

Implement anomaly detection techniques.

Use failure prediction models to estimate the risk of future failures.

f. Cognitive Analytics:

Analyze data to recognize patterns and correlations.

Generate actionable insights and recommendations.

2. Generative AI Solutions:

a. Data Synthesis:

Generate synthetic data to augment training datasets.

Simulate various failure scenarios for model robustness.

b. Advanced Predictions:

Use generative models to predict outcomes based on complex input data.

Analyze generated scenarios to forecast machine health.

c. Enhanced Diagnostics:

Create detailed diagnostic reports with generative models.

Develop conversational interfaces for interactive diagnostics.

d. Cognitive Insights:

Utilize AI to provide high-level contextual understanding.

Offer intelligent recommendations and optimizations based on generated insights.

These points outline the core steps for leveraging AI and generative AI in machine health management.
